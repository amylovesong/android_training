        You need these references later when modifying the views during the animation.\n

		3. Cache the config_shortAnimTime system property in a member variable. 
		This property defines a standard "short" duration for the animation. 
		This duration is ideal for subtle animations or animations that occur very frequently. 
		config_longAnimTime and config_mediumAnimTime are also available if you wish to use them.\n
